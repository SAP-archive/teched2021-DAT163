# Hands-on - Part 1 (Discover, Prepare, and Enrich)

As a Business Analyst or Data Steward, you need to understand and gain insight into your data. After accessing various data, profiling them and reviewing the profiling results you will be able to add a glossary term to a column in your dataset as well as provide a rating and comment on the dataset.

In this exercise, you will discover and interact with various connected systems, upload a dataset, profile the data, rate dataset, create a relationship with data and a glossary term

## Dataset Overview

You will interact with two different dataset:
* A table stored in a SAP HANA Database.
* A flat file (csv) which you will upload in a cloud data lake data repository

The first dataset, the SAP HANA Table, contains information about pharmaceutic claims for an insurance company.

It contains 8 fields:
* RECORD_ID (Unique Identifier associated to a claim)
* INSURANCE (Name of the insurance company)
* PLAN (Plan associated at the insurance company)
* PATIENT_ID (Unique Identifier of the patient this claim is for)
* OUTSTANDING (Amount for the drug)
* CO_PAY (Amount of co pay, if any)
* VISIT (Date of the visit associated to this claim)
* DRUG_NAME (Drug name for the claim)

The second dataset, the flat file you retrieved on the main page of this hands-on, contains a list of drugs which are supported by this insurance company.

It contains 6 fields:
* ORIG_PRODUCT (Non split entry)
* DRUG_NAME (Drug name)
* POTENCY (Potency associated to the drug)
* DOSAGE (Dosage for the drug)
* ROUTE_ADMINISTERED (How the drug is administered)
* NOTES (Additional notes, if any)

This hands on will focus on discovering these data, find patterns and data quality issues, and fix them.

## Log Into SAP Data Intelligence

25. The application displays a preview of the merge data.
<br>![](/exercises/ex1/images/Ex01_Part04_25.png)

26. The merged data now shows a null value for the column 'DRUG_NAME_0' when a record from the claim data is for a drug that is not listed in the list of supported drugs.
<br>![](/exercises/ex1/images/Ex01_Part04_26.png)

The enriched dataset now contains null records for the field 'DRUG_NAME_0' for the records in the claim dataset which the drug name did not exists in our reference.

There are potential multiple reasons for that. Some might be spelling mistakes of drug names, some other might be drugs that are not taken into account by the insurance company, some could be that the drug name in our claim was null.

You can now use this enriched dataset to isolate the data quality issues to further understand the data.
